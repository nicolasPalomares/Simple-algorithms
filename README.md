# Simple Algorithms
This repository contains a collection of basic Java algorithms I wrote for practice purposes, perfect for beginners looking to understand fundamental programming concepts. The algorithms included are:

1. Armstrong Number Checker: A program that determines if a number is an Armstrong number.
2. Sum of Digits: A program that calculates the sum of the digits of a number.
3. Binary Search: An implementation of the binary search algorithm to find an element in an array of integers.
4. Duplicate Character Remover: A program that removes duplicate characters from a string.
   
These algorithms are designed to be simple and easy to understand, making them great learning tools for those new to Java and programming in general.
